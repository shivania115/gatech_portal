# Georgia Diabetes Data Portal

This data portal is built to present county-level diabetes-related data in Georgia. The table contains the values of the charateristics for a county, and the heatmap shows the distribution of each charateristic.

The published version is at https://sklisa.github.io/gatech_portal/.

The project is built upon the following Stitch Example - Todo App, with GA map added to the page.

Stitch Example - Todo App

This sample app is intended to be used by following the 
[Todo tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-overview/) in the 
Stitch docs. It demonstrates the process of building a React Web app that 
connects to the Stitch backend and uses Atlas for data storage.
